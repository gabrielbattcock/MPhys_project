	N2 = {Purpose: pydicom is an open source package for reading and writing DICOM files using the python programming language. Methods: pydicom was first publicly released in Oct 2008, and has since had five version releases. Pydicom is a pure python package, installing and running on any platform on which python runs. DICOM structures are read and parsed into python data types, with the values and full details of the data elements accessible. Pydicom is hosted on a google code website (http://pydicom.googlecode.com), in a Mercurial distributed version control system, and is released under an MIT license. The website has an active issues list for requesting features and reporting bugs, a wiki section documenting how to install and use the code, example files, and a test suite. Performance profiling of reading files was improved greatly in the 0.9.4 release. Profiling of the code was analysed to find code bottlenecks and rework the slower sections. Results: Pydicom can read and write all standard DICOM files, including nested sequences such as found in DICOM RT files or in structured reports. The code has approximately 1200 downloads per release, and about 80 subscribers in an online discussion group. It is an installable module in the pythonxy distribution, and is used by other open source projects such as dicompyler, DiPy and RadPy. Performance profiling yielded an approximate three-fold reading speed improvement, to approximately 3 seconds per hundred images, comparable to python file reading with no parsing. Conclusions: Pydicom is a mature library offering a reliable, simple reading and writing of DICOM files from python code. It has been actively developed over several years and has a solid base of users in imaging and therapy projects.},

	Abstract = {We introduce new results connecting differential and morphological operators that provide a formal and theoretically grounded approach for stable and fast contour evolution. Contour evolution algorithms have been extensively used for boundary detection and tracking in computer vision. The standard solution based on partial differential equations and level-sets requires the use of numerical methods of integration that are costly computationally and may have stability issues. We present a morphological approach to contour evolution based on a new curvature morphological operator valid for surfaces of any dimension. We approximate the numerical solution of the curve evolution PDE by the successive application of a set of morphological operators defined on a binary level-set and with equivalent infinitesimal behavior. These operators are very fast, do not suffer numerical stability issues, and do not degrade the level set function, so there is no need to reinitialize it. Moreover, their implementation is much easier since they do not require the use of sophisticated numerical algorithms. We validate the approach providing a morphological implementation of the geodesic active contours, the active contours without borders, and turbopixels. In the experiments conducted, the morphological implementations converge to solutions equivalent to those achieved by traditional numerical solutions, but with significant gains in simplicity, speed, and stability.},

	Abstract = {A snake is an energy-minimizing spline guided by external constraint forces and influenced by image forces that pull it toward features such as lines and edges. Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest.},

	Abstract = {The liver morphological changes in relation to fibrosis stage in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have not yet been clearly understood. This study was to develop a liver surface nodularity (LSN) quantification program and to compare the fibrosis grades in simple steatosis (SS) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Thirty subjects (7 normal controls {$[$}NC{$]$}, 12 SS and 11 NASH) were studied. LSN quantification procedure was bias correction, boundary detection, segmentation and LSN measurement. LSN scores among three groups and fibrosis grades compared using Kruskal--Wallis H test. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. Mean LSN scores were NC 1.30 $\pm$0.09, SS 1.54 $\pm$0.21 and NASH 1.59 $\pm$0.23 (p = 0.008). Mean LSN scores according to fibrosis grade (F) were F0 1.30 $\pm$0.09, F1 1.45 $\pm$0.17 and F2\&F3 1.67 $\pm$0.20 (p = 0.001). The mean LSN score in F2\&F3 is significantly higher than that in F1 (p = 0.019). The AUROC curve to distinguish F1 and F2\&F3 was 0.788 (95{\%} CI 0.595--0.981, p = 0.019) at a cut-off LSN score greater than 1.48, and its diagnostic accuracy had 0.833 sensitivity and 0.727 specificity. This study developed LSN program and its clinical application demonstrated that the quantitative LSN scores can help to differentially diagnose fibrosis stage in NAFLD.},

	Abstract = {Effective capability to search biomedical articles based on visual properties of article images may significantly augment information retrieval in the future. In this paper, we present a new method to classify the window setting types of brain CT images. Windowing is a technique frequently used in the evaluation of CT scans, and is used to enhance contrast for the particular tissue or abnormality type being evaluated. In particular, it provides radiologists with an enhanced view of certain types of cranial abnormalities, such as the skull lesions and bone dysplasia which are usually examined using the " bone window" setting and illustrated in biomedical articles using "bone window images". Due to the inherent large variations of images among articles, it is important that the proposed method is robust. Our algorithm attained 90{\%} accuracy in classifying images as bone window or non-bone window in a 210 image data set.},

@article{Lamba:2014aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether Hounsfield numbers of soft tissues on unenhanced abdominal CT of the same patient vary on repeat scans done on two different manufacturers' MDCT scanners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A database search was performed to identify patients older than 18 years who underwent unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed both on a Volume CT (GE Healthcare) and a Definition AS Plus (Siemens Healthcare) 64-MDCT scanner within 12 months of each other. After excluding those patients for whom Hounsfield unit measurements would be affected by mitigating factors, 48 patients (mean age, 58.8 years) were identified. Hounsfield unit measurements were obtained in nine different soft-tissue anatomic locations on each scan, and the location of these sites was kept identical on each scan pair. Data were analyzed to evaluate Hounsfield unit differences between these scanners. RESULTS: In general, there was a low consistency in the Hounsfield unit measurements for each of these sites on scans obtained by the two scanners, with the subcutaneous fat in the left posterolateral flank showing the lowest correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.198). There were differences in the Hounsfield unit measurements obtained in all anatomic sites on scans obtained by both scanners. Mean Hounsfield unit measurements obtained on the Definition AS Plus scanner were lower than those obtained on the Volume CT scanner, with the intriguing exception of the anterior midline subcutaneous fat Hounsfield unit measurements, which were higher on the Definition AS Plus scanner. All differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hounsfield unit measurements for unenhanced abdominal soft tissues of the same patient vary between scanners of two common MDCT manufacturers.},

@article{Varma:2012aa,
	Abstract = {All modalities in radiology practice have become digital, and therefore deal with DICOM images. Image files that are compliant with part 10 of the DICOM standard are generally referred to as "DICOM format files" or simply "DICOM files" and are represented as ".dcm." DICOM differs from other image formats in that it groups information into data sets. A DICOM file consists of a header and image data sets packed into a single file. The information within the header is organized as a constant and standardized series of tags. By extracting data from these tags one can access important information regarding the patient demographics, study parameters, etc. In the interest of patient confidentiality, all information that can be used to identify the patient should be removed before DICOM images are transmitted over a network for educational or other purposes. In addition to the DICOM format, the radiologist routinely encounters images of several file formats such as JPEG, TIFF, GIF, and PNG. Each format has its own unique advantages and disadvantages, which must be taken into consideration when images are archived, used in teaching files, or submitted for publication. Knowledge about these formats and their attributes, such as image resolution, image compression, and image metadata, helps the radiologist in optimizing the archival, organization, and display of images. This article aims to increase the awareness among radiologists regarding DICOM and other image file formats encountered in clinical practice. It also suggests several tips and tricks that can be used by the radiologist so that the digital potential of these images can be fully utilized for maximization of workflow in the radiology practice.},

A computer algorithm was developed to measure LSN and derive a score. LSN scores, splenic volume, and the ratio of left lateral segment (LLS) to total liver volume (TLV) were measured from the same multiphasic liver CT examinations. Accuracy for differentiating cirrhotic from noncirrhotic livers was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Intra- and interobserver agreement was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient. Results Median LSN scores from nonenhanced thick-section CT images in cirrhotic livers (3.16; 56 livers) were significantly higher than in noncirrhotic livers (2.11; 38 livers; P < .001). LSN scores from the four CT imaging types (94 patients for each type) were very strongly correlated (range of Spearman r, 0.929?0.960).

CONCLUSION: MR elastography (MRE) appears to be the most reliable method for grading liver fibrosis, although the CT fibrosis score derived from the combination of caudate-to-right-lobe ratio and the diameters of the liver veins significantly correlates with the stage of fibrosis.},

@article{Procopet:2017aa,
	Abstract = {The concept of 'cirrhosis' is evolving and it is now clear that compensated and decompensated cirrhosis are completely different in terms of prognosis. Furthermore, the term 'advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD)' better reflects the continuum of histological changes occurring in the liver, which continue to progress even after cirrhosis has developed, and might regress after removing the etiological factor causing the liver disease. In compensated ACLD, portal hypertension marks the progression to a stage with higher risk of clinical complication and requires an appropriate evaluation and treatment. Invasive tests to diagnose cirrhosis (liver biopsy) and portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement and endoscopy) remain of crucial importance in several difficult clinical scenarios, but their need can be reduced by using different non-invasive tests in standard cases. Among non-invasive tests, the accepted use, major limitations and major benefits of serum markers of fibrosis, elastography and imaging methods are summarized in the present review.},

	Abstract = { PurposeTo determine whether quantification of liver surface nodularity (LSN) provides an estimate of the presence of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in patients with cirrhosis.Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study included a training cohort (n = 189) and separate external validation cohort (n = 78), both composed of patients with cirrhosis who underwent abdominal CT and hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement between 2010 and 2016. The LSN score, liver and spleen volumes, liver-to-spleen volume ratio, platelet count to spleen diameter ratio, Iranmanesh score, aspartate amino transferase--to-platelet ratio index, and Fibrosis-4 index were derived from CT images and serum laboratories. The accuracy of the various tests for predicting CSPH was evaluated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared by using the DeLong test. Student t test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used.ResultsOne hundred eighty-nine patients were analyzed (119 men [mean age $\pm$ standard deviation, 57 years $\pm$ 11; range, 29--81 years] and 70 women [mean age, 61 years $\pm$ 10; range, 34--83 years]; overall mean age, 58 years $\pm$ 10; range, 29--83 years). A total of 102 patients (54\%) had CSPH. LSN score correlated with HVPG (r = 0.75; P < .001). Patients with CSPH had a higher LSN score than did those without CSPH (3.2 $\pm$ 0.6 vs 2.4 $\pm$ 0.3; P < .001). A cutoff value of 2.8 had a positive predictive value of 88\% for CSPH; the AUROC of LSN was 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03. This was higher than that of other available noninvasive tests (DeLong, all P < .001). In the validation cohort, LSN score of 2.8 had a positive predictive value of 86\% for CSPH; the AUROC was 0.87 $\pm$ 0.04.ConclusionThe CT-based liver surface nodularity score demonstrated high diagnostic performance for detecting clinically significant portal hypertension and outperformed multiple other noninvasive tests.{\copyright} RSNA, 2018Online supplemental material is available for this article. },
